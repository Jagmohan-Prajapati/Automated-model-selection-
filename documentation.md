# Automated Model Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization using Bayesian Optimization: Enhancing Machine Learning Models

## Phase 1: Problem Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aims to develop an automated system for model selection and hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian optimization techniques. The goal is to enhance the performance of machine learning models by automatically selecting the best model and optimizing its hyperparameters.

### Objectives
1. Implement an automated model selection process.
2. Develop a Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning.
3. Enhance the performance of machine learning models through automated optimization.
4. Create a user-friendly interface for the automated model selection and optimization system.

### Dataset
The project uses the "House Votes 84" dataset, which contains voting records of U.S. House of Representatives Congressmen on key issues. The dataset includes 16 features and a binary target variable (Democrat or Republican).

### Challenges
1. Handling missing values in the dataset.
2. Selecting appropriate models for the classification task.
3. Defining an effective search space for hyperparameters.
4. Implementing Bayesian optimization for efficient hyperparameter tuning.
5. Creating a user-friendly interface for non-technical users.

### Success Criteria
1. Improved model performance compared to baseline models.
2. Reduced time and effort in model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
3. A functional and intuitive user interface for the automated system.

## Phase 2: Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. Handle missing values using imputation techniques.
2. Remove duplicates and irrelevant features.
3. Encode categorical variables.
4. Scale or normalize features.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Analyze feature distributions and correlations.
2. Identify patterns and potential outliers.

### Feature Engineering
1. Create new features if necessary.
2. Select relevant features for model training.

### Data Split
1. Split the dataset into training (70%), validation (20%), and testing (10%) sets.

### Define Hyperparameter Search Space
1. Identify key hyperparameters for each model.
2. Define appropriate ranges for each hyperparameter.

## Phase 3: Model Training and Evaluation

2. Compare performance of optimized models with baseline models.

## Phase 4: Model Deployment and Interface Development

### Model Deployment
1. Prepare the best-performing model for deployment.
2. Implement model serialization and deserialization.
